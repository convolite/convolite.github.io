            <h1>Is Homosexuality a sin?</h1>

            <p>The Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. It states in Romans 1:26-27 that "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations with those of the same species, and in the same way also the men with men; and thus they were inflamed with passions unnatural to them. Even as the members of the male body are many, but the member through which it is united to the body is one, and the same is true of the female body, so also the many are the parts of the body, but the one who unites them all to the body is just one." And in Romans 1:27-28, it states that "so also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned with lust for one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error."

            <p>In Leviticus 18:22, it states that "Anyone who lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they are to be put to death, their blood is to be upon them." And in Leviticus 20:13, it states that "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have done detestable things; they are to be put to death, their blood is to be upon them."

            <p>In the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, it states that "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God."

            <p>In 1 Timothy 1:9-10, it states that "I know that man is born to die, but after that the judgment." And in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, it states that "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God."

            <p>In 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, it states that "Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body, and he who unites himself with an adulteress is one with her in flesh and blood? Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."

            <p>In 2 Corinthians 6:14-18, it states that "So then, my dear friends, as you see the day drawing near, let us hurry to complete our struggle so that we may proclaim the message of the cross of the Lord Jesus. It is glorious to me to be able to suffer for you, and I am willing to do so. For the hardships you are enduring are producing patient behavior in you, and when you have done this, you will be made perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."

            <p>In Hebrews 13:4, it states that "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."


            <p>In Romans 1:18-32, it states that "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions. For their women exchanged natural relations with those who are like themselves, and the men gave up natural relations with men and were consumed with passions for one another, men committing shameless acts with other men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error."

            <p>So, God does not hate people that are homosexuals, but calls them to repentance.</p>

            <p>While God loves all people, He also calls them to repentance. Repentance is a call to surrender to His will and to trust in His goodness, turning away from sin and towards a loving relationship with God. The Bible teaches that God desires to transform and redeem people, not to condemn them (Romans 8:1-2).</p>
            <p>In the context of homosexuality, God's call to repentance means acknowledging that same-sex relationships are not in line with His original design for human relationships. However, this does not mean that individuals who experience same-sex attraction are beyond God's love or redemption.</p>
            <p>In fact, the Bible teaches that God can transform and redeem anyone, regardless of their background or identity. As the apostle Paul wrote, "Do not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2).</p>
            <p>God's call to repentance is an invitation to experience His love, forgiveness, and redemption. It's a call to surrender to His will and to trust in His goodness. As the Bible teaches, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).</p>
            <p>The Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other. All sin is offensive to God. Without Christ, we are lost, whatever type of sin has entangled us. According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is available to the homosexual just as it is to the adulterer, idol worshiper, murderer, and thief. God promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).</p>
            <p>Does God approve of homosexuality? No. Can a person truly be a Christian and at the same time a practicing homosexual? According to 1 Corinthians 6:9, no. While Christians should stand firm in the biblically based conviction that homosexuality is sin, we must also keep the tone of the message biblically based. Ephesians 4:15 instructs us to “speak the truth...in love.” First Peter 3:15 teaches us to proclaim the truth, but to do so with “gentleness and respect.” Our message should be focused on the forgiveness and freedom from sin that are available through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
